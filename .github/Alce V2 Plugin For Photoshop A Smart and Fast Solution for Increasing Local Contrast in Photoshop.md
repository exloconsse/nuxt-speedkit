4. The main slider is the Amount slider, which controls the intensity of the contrast enhancement. You can drag it left or right to adjust the effect. A higher value will result in a stronger contrast boost, while a lower value will result in a subtler effect.
5. The other sliders are optional and allow you to fine-tune the effect. The Radius slider controls the size of the area affected by the contrast enhancement. A higher value will affect larger areas, while a lower value will affect smaller areas. The Protect Highlights slider allows you to preserve the details in the brightest areas of your image. A higher value will reduce the contrast enhancement in the highlights, while a lower value will increase it.
